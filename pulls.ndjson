{"pull_number":"19180","title":"Hybrid model loading with DirectIO and MMAP","body":"This is a draft of the hybrid model loading. It combines `mmap` for host buffers and `DirectIO` for device buffers.\r\n\r\n- Allows weight streaming from disk with the CPU backend\r\n- In case the backend is not capable of asynchronous updating the loading falls back to `mmap` (allows backends to decide whether it supports DirectIO or not) \r\n\r\nCurrently only the non-Windows path is implemented. Windows path will follow.","pull_head_sha":"ec102315318e629b96c4e1da5997fe3b134236d8","loci_pr_branch":"loci/pr-19180-hybrid_model_loading","short_merge_base":"b5b8fa1","loci_main_branch":"loci/main-b5b8fa1"}
