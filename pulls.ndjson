{"pull_number":"19193","title":"Refactor `vk_semaphore` to be a shared_ptr object","body":"When allocating a vk_semaphore, we would return the pointer to the object in the vector's memory space. This was prone to change when the vector was reallocated to resize, resulting in the pointer pointing to nonsense.\r\n\r\nAlso add the `vk_device` which owns the semaphore to the struct, for use at cleanup time, to allow semaphores to be owned by the non-main device.\r\n\r\nFinally, adds helpers for setting and awaiting the semaphores.\r\n\r\nThis change was prepared with the help of Github Copilot. I don't remember how much. This change is part of a larger change I'm working on. I understand the change and am prepared to discuss it with a human reviewer.","pull_head_sha":"e0c9c015062318b18685c34ec1e345965884eb68","loci_pr_branch":"loci/pr-19193-work-sredman-vulkan-semaphore-shared-ptr","short_merge_base":"d284baf","loci_main_branch":"loci/main-d284baf"}
